## Taiwan Academic Network Conference

* A Case Study of APT Attack in Taiwan Academic Network(2014)
	* Based on a real APT case in TANet, validating the attack mechanism of each stage in APT Killer Chain model. Analyze the hacker attack pattern in TANet and provide suggestions to defense APT attack in order to reduce the impact.


## Master's Thesis

* A Study of Detecting Malicious Website Code Based on Text Mining Techniques(2013)
	* This research proposes a malicious website detecting mechanism based on mutual information text segmentation and text mining technique takes no manpower and wasted time on constructing website program parser and digging out feature of different attacking code for different vulnerabilities.


## International Conference on Business and Information

* BotNet C&C Control Behavior Analysis Using HoneyPot and Reverse Hacking Techniques(2013)
	* Using reverse engineering techniques to modify the BotNet client to reverse hacking into the BotNet Command and Control Server to monitor the BotNet control behavior data, therefore, we found botnet attacks have highly cooperate behavior and control of botnet shifting behaviors.
